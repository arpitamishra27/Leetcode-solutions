""Given a characters array letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order and a character target, return the smallest character in the array that is larger than target.

Note that the letters wrap around.

For example, if target == 'z' and letters == ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'.
 

Example 1:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Example 2:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
Example 3:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "d"
Output: "f"""

class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        low=0
        high=len(letters)-1
        
        while low<=high:
            mid=(low+high)//2
            
            if letters[mid]<=target:
                low=mid+1
                
            else:
                high=mid-1
                
        if low<=len(letters)-1:
             return letters[low]
        else:
            return letters[0]
