""You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"""

class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        sum_s,sum_t=0,0
        i=-1
        for i in range (0,len(s)):
            sum_s+=ord(s[i])
            sum_t+=ord(t[i])

        sum_t+=ord(t[i+1])
        
        diff=sum_t-sum_s
        
        return chr(diff)
